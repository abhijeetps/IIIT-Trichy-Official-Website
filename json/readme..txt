"descriptionAboutTheEvent": add the description of the Notice.

====================
What is JSON?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
It is easy for humans to read and write. 
It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
Because of these reasons, I have used format to store data and it will be used to update EVENTS, NEWS and NOTICES.

====================
JSON Format?

The sample format for JSON is
    
    {"key", "value"}

For example, 

    { "JSON" : "JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation"}

Here,
    "JSON" is the key, and 
    "JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation" is the value.

====================

Can JSON Object be nested?

Yes, JSON object can be nested. 
The object can be nested and can be made more complex as shown

{
    "key1" : {
        "subkey1" : "value",
        "subkey1" : "value"
    },

    "key2" : {
        "subkey1" : "value",
        "subkey2" : "value"
    }
}

For example,

{
    "event1" : {
        "description" : "Some Description",
        url: "some/url/"
    }

}
